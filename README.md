# extension-iec61970
This repository contains XML files that implement the extension of the IEC 61970 standard for modeling prosumer agents in the context of photovoltaic distributed generation (PDG). The files are based on the Common Information Model (CIM) and aim to enhance interoperability, real-time monitoring, and data integration for smart grid applications.
This project is the first effort to create a group of new classes and relationships to the IEC 61970.

Following, there is the proposed UML for the prosumer class.
